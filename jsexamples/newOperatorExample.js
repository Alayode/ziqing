* Description
*
* I never really understood the new operator very well before I always thought
* It was just used for creating new objects. There is alot more behind this JavaScript
* Keyword.
*
*  new constructor[ ([ arguments ]) ]
*
*
*   constructor  - a function that specifies a type
*   arguments    - a list of values that the constructor will be called with.

/* The new operator creates an instance of a user-defined object type or one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function */
