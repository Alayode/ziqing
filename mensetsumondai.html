 <!--Centering in CSS-->
 <!--Centering Content-->



 <!--if you want to center a box on a page or center it inside the element it sits in, you can set the left margin and the right margin-->
 <!--auto. In order to center a box on the page   you need to set a width for the box-->

<head>
<style type="text/css">
 body {
 text-align: center;}
 p {
 width: 300px;
 padding: 50px;
 border: 20px solid #0088dd;}
 p.example {
 margin: 10px auto 10px auto;
 text-align: left;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>Analog synthesizers are often said to have a "warmer" sound than their digital counterparts.</p>
<p class="example">Analog synthesizers are often said to have a "warmer" sound than their digital counterparts.</p>
</body>


<!--
Once you have specified the width of the , setting the left and right margins to auto will make the browser put an
equal gap on each side of the box. THis centers the box on the page OR within the element that the box sits inside).

In order for this to work in older browsers (particularly IE6), the element that the box sits insidde should have a text-align
property on the centered box if you do not want the text inside it to be centered


The most common and (therefore)  easiest type of centering is that of lines
of text in a paragraph or in a heading. CSS has the property 'text-align' for that


-->

<style>
  p  { text-align: center }
  h2 { text-align: center }
</style>


<!--
Centering a block or image

 Sometimes it is not the text that needs to be centered but the block as a whole.
 Or phrased differently : we want the left and right margin to be equal .
 The way to do that is to set the margins to 'auto' This is normally used with a block of
 fixed width, because if the block itself is flexible.

 It will simply take up al the available width. Here is an example:

 -->


P.blocktext {
  margin-left:auto;
  margin-right:auto;
  width: 6em;
}

<P class="blocktext">
  This rather narrow block of text is centered. Note that the linesinside the blockquote
  Note that the lines inside the block are not centered (they are left-aligned).Unlike in
  the earlier example.
</P>


<!-- Closures -->

<!--
Like in most modern programming languages. Javascript uses lexical Scoping. That functions are executed using the
variable scope that was in effect when they were defined, not the variable scope that is in effet when they are
invoked.

Technically all Javascript functions are closures: they are objects and they have a scope chain that is
associated with them. Most functions are invoked using the same scope chain that was in effect when the function
was defined, and it doesn't really matter that there is a closure involved.

Closures can become interesting when the function was defined, and it doesn't really matter that there is a closure
involved.

-->

<!-- Understanding closures -->
<script>
var scope = "global scope"; // a global variable

function checkscope(){
  var scope = "local scope"; //local variable
  function f(){ return scope;} // A local variable
    return f();       //Return the value in scope here
}

checkscope()   // => "local scope"

</script>

<!--
function counter() {
  var n = 0;
  return {
    //there are two methods
    count: function() {return n++}, //returns the next integer
    reset: function() { n=0; } //resets the internal state in this case  0
  };
}

//  console.log(counter());

  // The counter function returns a counter object { count: [Function], reset: [Function] }

  var c = counter(), d = counter();

  // console.log(c,d);
  console.log(c.count());            // => 0
    console.log(d.count());            // => 0 they count independently
      console.log(c.reset());            // => reset() and count() methods share state
        console.log(c.count());            // => 0: because we reset c
          console.log(d.count());            // => 1: d was not reset


// The first thing to understand is that the two methods share access to the private variable n.
// The second thing to understand is that each invocation of counter() creates a new scope chain and new private variable
// For example calling the object three times gives you 3 counter objects with DIFFERENT PRIVATE VARIABLES
// So calling calling count on one counter object has no effect on the other. -->

<!-- #Null and Undefined -->

<!--Javascript
//null is a language keyword that evaluates to a special value that is usually used to indicate the absence of a value.

Coming from SQL NULL means no value as opposed to a field containing 0, or an empty string or just spaces.

using the typeof operator on null returns the string "object", indicating that null can be thought of as a special
object value that indicate "no value" for numbers and strings as well as objects.

// Undefined represents a deeper kind of absence. It is the value of variable that have not been initialized and the value you
// get when you query the value of variable that has not been initialized yet and the value you get when you query the value of an object
// property or array element that does not exist yet.


The undefined value is also returned by functions that have no return value, and the value of function parameters for null


JS history Actionscript which is a deviation from ECMAScript 3

ECMAScript  3 is a read/write variable and it can be set to any value. This error is corrected in ECMAScript 5
and now undefined is a read-only in that version of that language. If you apply the typeof operator to the undefined value, it
returns "undefined, indicating that this value is the sole memeber of a special type"



DESPITE undefined and null's differences both have some similarities:

  -  they both indicate absence of value and can often be used interchangeably.
  -  the equality operator "==" considers them to be equal. ( Use the strict equality operator "===")
  -  Both are falsy values they behave like false when a boolean value is required.
  - they both don't have Properties or methods.
          - null.prototype // returns TypeError  "Cannot read property 'prototype' of null "
          - using null or [] or . also returns a TypeError

  In conclusion wheneveryou need to assign one of these values to a function null is always the right choice.
-->


<!-- #Hoisting in JavaScript -->
<!--

In Some C-like programming languages each block of code within curly braces has its own scope and variables are
                    not visible outside of the block. in which they are declared.

                        THIS IS CALLED BLOCK SCOPE THIS IS NOT IN JAVASCRIPT

  JavaScript uses function scope: variable are visible within the function in which they were defined and with any function that are nested within that function

-->

<script>
var scope = 'global';

function f() {
    var scope;
    console.log(scope);// will print undefined
    var scope = 'local';
    console.log(scope);// will print local
}

f();
</script>


<!--Prototypes-->
<!--
  When a constructor creates an object, that object implicitly references the constructor's "prototype" property
  for the purpose of resolving property references. The constructor's "prototype" property for the purpose of property
  references. The constructor's "prototype" property can be reference by the program expression constructor.prototype
  and Properties added to an object's prototype are shared, through inheritance, by all objects sharing the prototype.
  Alternatively a new object may be created with an explicity specified prototype by using the Object.create built-in function.

Another way to look at prototypes is when a object that creates a new Array() uses the Array.Prototype as its prototype, and the object
created by new Date() uses Date.Prototype as its prototype.

One of the rare objects with no prototype is

Object.prototype this does not inherit any properites




-->

<script>
  var o1 = Object.create({x:1, y:2});
  // o1 inherits the properties of x and y.
</script>

<!--
You can pass null to create a new object that does not have a prototype, but if you do this, the newly created object will not inherits
anything, not eveen basic methods like toString()

-->

<!--
What happens when you pass null to create a new object that does not have a prototype, but if you do this, the newly
created object will not inherit anything, not even basic mathods like toString()
-->

<script>
var o2 = Object.create(null);
// o2 will now inherit no props or methods.
</script>

<!--
If you want to create an ordrinary empty object (like the object return by {} or new Object()), Just pass the
Object.prototype:
-->

<script>
var o3 = Object.create(Object.prototype); //o3 is like {} or new Object().
</script>

<script>
function inherit(p){
  // lets make sure that p is a non-null object.
    if (p == null)
        throw TypeError();
    if (Object.create) // if the Object.create is defined..
          return Object.create(p); //then we will be able to use it .
}


var t = typeof p;
console.log(p);

</script>

<!--
Because there are several versions of HTML each web page should begin
with a DOCTYPE Declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML
the page is using (although browser which usually display the page even if
it is not included)

The DOCTYPE helps render the page correctly.

A little on XHTML was written in XML, you will sometimes see pages that use
the XHTML strict DOCTYPE start with the optional XML Declaration.
Where this isused it should be the first thing in a document.

THE XML DECLARATION MUST BE THE FIRST THING IN THE DOCUMENT THERE MUST BE NOTHING

How to Use Different CSS Style Sheets For Different Browsers
And How to Hide CSS Code from Older Browsers

  In an ideal world, you only need one set of CSS style sheets for your website, and those styles
   will work with every browser currently being used. This, as every webmaster soon finds out when
   he/she uses CSS, is a pipe dream. The modern browsers all have uneven levels of implementation of
   the CSS standards. As though this isn't bad enough, their implementations are often buggy — and
   they don't share the same bugs! And when you have solved that tricky bit, you find that your
   site has certain visitors (often your best customers)
  who, for various reasons, are using older browsers that have only rudimentary support for CSS.


  #The Good and Bad News

  The bad news is that there is no standard documented method to include or exclude style sheets from being used by every browser still being used on the Internet.

  All is not lost however. The good news is that there are a number of tricks, workarounds and even non-standard but documented methods available that you can use to have your style sheet included by some browsers and not others. The workarounds often rely on known bugs in certain versions of specific browsers.

  On the other hand, even with these workarounds and tricks, you will probably find that there are certain browsers that you want to code for but do not have any reliable means to detect and work around. However, with the help of the tips listed here, you should be able to design a CSS-based website that works with the most commonly used browsers
  Preliminary Tips for Coding

  Before you start coding your site using CSS for specific browsers, here are some tips that hopefully will make your life easier.

      #Design From Scratch

      Most webmasters who have had to convert their existing non-CSS website to CSS say that they find it easier to design their site from scratch in CSS than to try to find a way to reproduce their old layout in CSS.

      Another reason for designing from scratch is that CSS allows you to do many things not possible using the old paradigms. Rethinking your entire design allows you to take advantage of the new possibilities.

      (Note: if yours is a brand new website, then this paragraph obviously doesn't apply to you.)
      Code to Follow the CSS Standards First

      Many web designers have found that it is far easier to develop their CSS code for a standards-compliant browser (which nowadays include all modern browsers: Internet Explorer ("IE") 8 and above, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Chrome) and then only later add the workarounds to make their code work for IE 6 and 7, than to start with IE6 and IE7 and try to make it work for a modern browser.

      It is also logical to write for a more standards-compliant browser first: old browsers like IE 6 and 7 are rapidly disappearing from the Internet so much so that many sites (including a number of Google's services) don't even bother to support them. There will definitely come a day when those browsers vanish completely from the world, and when it does, all you have to do is to remove the workarounds which you've created and you're done. If you write your main style sheet with styles that are coded in a non-standard way to deal with the bugs in IE 6 and 7 first, you will end up having to rewrite everything when it happens.

      This is not to say that the modern browsers do not have its own share of CSS bugs. As such, my personal recommendation is to test with at least 2 or 3 of the modern browsers each time you write your code. Note that if you test with the bare minimum of 2 browsers, make sure you choose those that use completely different display technologies (called "rendering engines"). For example, IE 11 uses its own rendering engine, as does Firefox 28. However, Chrome, Safari, Konqueror and versions of Opera later than 12.x all use a rendering engine that is based on code created originally for Konqueror. So if you must test using only 2 browsers, at least choose them from completely different families, like IE and Firefox, or something like that. This way, you can be more confident that your site looks good not because of a bug in the rendering engine, but because your code correctly reflects what needs to be done to produce that effect. You should also periodically validate your CSS code with perhaps the W3 Consortium's free style sheet validator. Only after having done the above, should you add the workarounds for IE 6 and 7.
      Use External Style Sheets and Take Advantage of the "Cascading" Aspect of Cascading Style Sheets

      One way to handle the bugs and omissions existing in different browsers is to put all your standards-compliant CSS code in a separate (external) style sheet file that is loaded by every browser.

      Then, when you find that a specific browser requires a workaround, use the methods listed below to load an additional style sheet designed specifically for that particular browser. The beauty of CSS is that you can redefine a different style for the same selector and have the last-defined style override all preceding definitions.

      Placing your main standards-compliant style sheet and the browser-specific style sheets in different external files allow you to simply remove a particular file in the future should that version of the browser cease to be used.
      There's No Substitute for Testing

      Even when you have validated your CSS code, you should still test your code manually using different browsers. There is no substitute for this: just because your code is standards-compliant does not mean that the browser will render it the way you want it to.

      You can find information on how you can install multiple versions of different browsers on a single machine from http://www.thesitewizard.com/webdesign/multiplebrowsers.shtml

  #Including or Excluding Style Sheets for IE 5 to 9

  One of the easiest things to do is to specify that a certain style sheet be loaded only by IE 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8 or 9, or be excluded from them.

  Microsoft provides a non-standard extension that allows you to detect those versions of IE, and include or exclude code depending on the version. The extensions, called "conditional comments", only work for those versions of IE and none other. Specifically, they do not work on IE 10 and later, which behave just like other browsers in ignoring those conditional comments.

  To cause (say) a CSS file like "iespecific.css" to be loaded by IE 6 and not other browsers, use the following code in the HEAD section of your web page:

-->

<!-- How to Hide CSS from IE 5 and Below for Windows -->
<style type="text/css"><!--
p.largetext/* */ { font-size: 200% ; }
--></style>
...(etc)...
<p class="largetext">
