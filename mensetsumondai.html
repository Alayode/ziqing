 <!--Centering in CSS-->
 <!--Centering Content-->



 <!--if you want to center a box on a page or center it inside the element it sits in, you can set the left margin and the right margin-->
 <!--auto. In order to center a box on the page   you need to set a width for the box-->

<head>
<style type="text/css">
 body {
 text-align: center;}
 p {
 width: 300px;
 padding: 50px;
 border: 20px solid #0088dd;}
 p.example {
 margin: 10px auto 10px auto;
 text-align: left;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>Analog synthesizers are often said to have a "warmer" sound than their digital counterparts.</p>
<p class="example">Analog synthesizers are often said to have a "warmer" sound than their digital counterparts.</p>
</body>


<!--
Once you have specified the width of the , setting the left and right margins to auto will make the browser put an
equal gap on each side of the box. THis centers the box on the page OR within the element that the box sits inside).

In order for this to work in older browsers (particularly IE6), the element that the box sits insidde should have a text-align
property on the centered box if you do not want the text inside it to be centered


The most common and (therefore)  easiest type of centering is that of lines
of text in a paragraph or in a heading. CSS has the property 'text-align' for that


-->

<style>
  p  { text-align: center }
  h2 { text-align: center }
</style>


<!--
Centering a block or image

 Sometimes it is not the text that needs to be centered but the block as a whole.
 Or phrased differently : we want the left and right margin to be equal .
 The way to do that is to set the margins to 'auto' This is normally used with a block of
 fixed width, because if the block itself is flexible.

 It will simply take up al the available width. Here is an example:

 -->


P.blocktext {
  margin-left:auto;
  margin-right:auto;
  width: 6em;
}

<P class="blocktext">
  This rather narrow block of text is centered. Note that the linesinside the blockquote
  Note that the lines inside the block are not centered (they are left-aligned).Unlike in
  the earlier example.
</P>


<!-- Closures -->

<!--
Like in most modern programming languages. Javascript uses lexical Scoping. That functions are executed using the
variable scope that was in effect when they were defined, not the variable scope that is in effet when they are
invoked.

Technically all Javascript functions are closures: they are objects and they have a scope chain that is
associated with them. Most functions are invoked using the same scope chain that was in effect when the function
was defined, and it doesn't really matter that there is a closure involved.

Closures can become interesting when the function was defined, and it doesn't really matter that there is a closure
involved.

-->

<!-- Understanding closures -->
<script>
var scope = "global scope"; // a global variable

function checkscope(){
  var scope = "local scope"; //local variable
  function f(){ return scope;} // A local variable
    return f();       //Return the value in scope here
}

checkscope()   // => "local scope"

</script>

<!--
function counter() {
  var n = 0;
  return {
    //there are two methods
    count: function() {return n++}, //returns the next integer
    reset: function() { n=0; } //resets the internal state in this case  0
  };
}

//  console.log(counter());

  // The counter function returns a counter object { count: [Function], reset: [Function] }

  var c = counter(), d = counter();

  // console.log(c,d);
  console.log(c.count());            // => 0
    console.log(d.count());            // => 0 they count independently
      console.log(c.reset());            // => reset() and count() methods share state
        console.log(c.count());            // => 0: because we reset c
          console.log(d.count());            // => 1: d was not reset


// The first thing to understand is that the two methods share access to the private variable n.
// The second thing to understand is that each invocation of counter() creates a new scope chain and new private variable
// For example calling the object three times gives you 3 counter objects with DIFFERENT PRIVATE VARIABLES
// So calling calling count on one counter object has no effect on the other. -->


<!-- #Hoisting in JavaScript -->
<!--

In Some C-like programming languages each block of code within curly braces has its own scope and variables are
                    not visible outside of the block. in which they are declared.

                        THIS IS CALLED BLOCK SCOPE THIS IS NOT IN JAVASCRIPT

  JavaScript uses function scope: variable are visible within the function in which they were defined and with any function that are nested within that function

-->

<script>
var scope = 'global';

function f() {
    var scope;
    console.log(scope);// will print undefined
    var scope = 'local';
    console.log(scope);// will print local
}

f();
</script>


<!--Prototypes-->
<!--
  When a constructor creates an object, that object implicitly references the constructor's "prototype" property
  for the purpose of resolving property references. The constructor's "prototype" property for the purpose of property
  references. The constructor's "prototype" property can be reference by the program expression constructor.prototype
  and Properties added to an object's prototype are shared, through inheritance, by all objects sharing the prototype.
  Alternatively a new object may be created with an explicity specified prototype by using the Object.create built-in function.

Another way to look at prototypes is when a object that creates a new Array() uses the Array.Prototype as its prototype, and the object
created by new Date() uses Date.Prototype as its prototype.

One of the rare objects with no prototype is

Object.prototype this does not inherit any properites




-->

<script>
  var o1 = Object.create({x:1, y:2});
  // o1 inherits the properties of x and y.
</script>

<!--
You can pass null to create a new object that does not have a prototype, but if you do this, the newly created object will not inherits
anything, not eveen basic methods like toString()

-->

<!--
What happens when you pass null to create a new object that does not have a prototype, but if you do this, the newly
created object will not inherit anything, not even basic mathods like toString()
-->

<script>
var o2 = Object.create(null);
// o2 will now inherit no props or methods.
</script>

<!--
If you want to create an ordrinary empty object (like the object return by {} or new Object()), Just pass the
Object.prototype:
-->

<script>
var o3 = Object.create(Object.prototype); //o3 is like {} or new Object().
</script>

<script>
function inherit(p){
  // lets make sure that p is a non-null object.
    if (p == null)
        throw TypeError();
    if (Object.create) // if the Object.create is defined..
          return Object.create(p); //then we will be able to use it .
}


var t = typeof p;
console.log(p);

</script>

How to Use Different CSS Style Sheets For Different Browsers
And How to Hide CSS Code from Older Browsers

  In an ideal world, you only need one set of CSS style sheets for your website, and those styles
   will work with every browser currently being used. This, as every webmaster soon finds out when
   he/she uses CSS, is a pipe dream. The modern browsers all have uneven levels of implementation of
   the CSS standards. As though this isn't bad enough, their implementations are often buggy — and
   they don't share the same bugs! And when you have solved that tricky bit, you find that your
   site has certain visitors (often your best customers)
  who, for various reasons, are using older browsers that have only rudimentary support for CSS.


  #The Good and Bad News

  The bad news is that there is no standard documented method to include or exclude style sheets from being used by every browser still being used on the Internet.

  All is not lost however. The good news is that there are a number of tricks, workarounds and even non-standard but documented methods available that you can use to have your style sheet included by some browsers and not others. The workarounds often rely on known bugs in certain versions of specific browsers.

  On the other hand, even with these workarounds and tricks, you will probably find that there are certain browsers that you want to code for but do not have any reliable means to detect and work around. However, with the help of the tips listed here, you should be able to design a CSS-based website that works with the most commonly used browsers
  Preliminary Tips for Coding

  Before you start coding your site using CSS for specific browsers, here are some tips that hopefully will make your life easier.

      #Design From Scratch

      Most webmasters who have had to convert their existing non-CSS website to CSS say that they find it easier to design their site from scratch in CSS than to try to find a way to reproduce their old layout in CSS.

      Another reason for designing from scratch is that CSS allows you to do many things not possible using the old paradigms. Rethinking your entire design allows you to take advantage of the new possibilities.

      (Note: if yours is a brand new website, then this paragraph obviously doesn't apply to you.)
      Code to Follow the CSS Standards First

      Many web designers have found that it is far easier to develop their CSS code for a standards-compliant browser (which nowadays include all modern browsers: Internet Explorer ("IE") 8 and above, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Chrome) and then only later add the workarounds to make their code work for IE 6 and 7, than to start with IE6 and IE7 and try to make it work for a modern browser.

      It is also logical to write for a more standards-compliant browser first: old browsers like IE 6 and 7 are rapidly disappearing from the Internet so much so that many sites (including a number of Google's services) don't even bother to support them. There will definitely come a day when those browsers vanish completely from the world, and when it does, all you have to do is to remove the workarounds which you've created and you're done. If you write your main style sheet with styles that are coded in a non-standard way to deal with the bugs in IE 6 and 7 first, you will end up having to rewrite everything when it happens.

      This is not to say that the modern browsers do not have its own share of CSS bugs. As such, my personal recommendation is to test with at least 2 or 3 of the modern browsers each time you write your code. Note that if you test with the bare minimum of 2 browsers, make sure you choose those that use completely different display technologies (called "rendering engines"). For example, IE 11 uses its own rendering engine, as does Firefox 28. However, Chrome, Safari, Konqueror and versions of Opera later than 12.x all use a rendering engine that is based on code created originally for Konqueror. So if you must test using only 2 browsers, at least choose them from completely different families, like IE and Firefox, or something like that. This way, you can be more confident that your site looks good not because of a bug in the rendering engine, but because your code correctly reflects what needs to be done to produce that effect. You should also periodically validate your CSS code with perhaps the W3 Consortium's free style sheet validator. Only after having done the above, should you add the workarounds for IE 6 and 7.
      Use External Style Sheets and Take Advantage of the "Cascading" Aspect of Cascading Style Sheets

      One way to handle the bugs and omissions existing in different browsers is to put all your standards-compliant CSS code in a separate (external) style sheet file that is loaded by every browser.

      Then, when you find that a specific browser requires a workaround, use the methods listed below to load an additional style sheet designed specifically for that particular browser. The beauty of CSS is that you can redefine a different style for the same selector and have the last-defined style override all preceding definitions.

      Placing your main standards-compliant style sheet and the browser-specific style sheets in different external files allow you to simply remove a particular file in the future should that version of the browser cease to be used.
      There's No Substitute for Testing

      Even when you have validated your CSS code, you should still test your code manually using different browsers. There is no substitute for this: just because your code is standards-compliant does not mean that the browser will render it the way you want it to.

      You can find information on how you can install multiple versions of different browsers on a single machine from http://www.thesitewizard.com/webdesign/multiplebrowsers.shtml

  #Including or Excluding Style Sheets for IE 5 to 9

  One of the easiest things to do is to specify that a certain style sheet be loaded only by IE 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8 or 9, or be excluded from them.

  Microsoft provides a non-standard extension that allows you to detect those versions of IE, and include or exclude code depending on the version. The extensions, called "conditional comments", only work for those versions of IE and none other. Specifically, they do not work on IE 10 and later, which behave just like other browsers in ignoring those conditional comments.

  To cause (say) a CSS file like "iespecific.css" to be loaded by IE 6 and not other browsers, use the following code in the HEAD section of your web page:

-->

 <!--What is Box Model ?-->
    <!-- #BoxModel -->

<!--
  in HTML all elements can be considered as representations of boxes to in
  CSS when we say BOX model its used when talking about the design and layout

Now we can step in a little further and understand the available properties that
can be adjust to control its appearance

    border - separates the edge of one box from another
    margin - sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap  between the borders of two adjacent boxes
    padding - is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. the more padding you add the more readable the contents it contains become.





-->

<style>
  div {
    background-color: inherit;

    padding: inherit;
    border: 25px;
    margin: auto;
  }
</style>
<div>I am the Box Model.</div>


<!--Display none-->
  <!--
  The display Property  allows you to turn an inline element into a block level element

      display: none;
      /*This hides the element from the page, the element acts as though it is not on the page at all*/
      display:block;
      /*this causes an inline element to act liek a block-level element*/
      display:inline;
          causes a block-level element to act like an inline element
      display:inline-block;

<!--How do you implement Web pages sketch/ Visual designs ?-->


<!--
    #Wireframes

    A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of the site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
    and how much space it might require.

    When working with designers will take the elements that need to appear on each page and start by  creating wireframes.
    This Involves sketching or shading areas where each element of the page will go

            logo
            primary
            navigation
            heading and main bodies of text
            user logins


     I have not been creating many wireframes from scratch in a while  by you can ensure that all the inforation that needs to
            be on the page is included except the color scheme or font choices backgrounds or images for the website in the wireframe.
            it should focus on what the information needs to be on.

            Wireframes make design easier because you know what information needs to appear on which page before considering


        Getting your message across using Design

            The Primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate Organizing and prioritizing information on a pagehelps users understand its
            importance and what order to read it in.

                        #CONTENT

                            a masthead or logo
                            links to navigate the site
                            links to related content and other
                            login or membership options
                            ability for users to comment
                            copyright information
                            links to privacy policies

                        #PRIORITIZING

                            Making parts of the page look distinct from the surrounding content,
                            designers draw attention to or away from those items

                            #Visual Hierarchy
                            Designers create something known a visual hierarchy to help users focus on the key messages that will
                            draw peoples atttention and then guide then to subsequent messages.

                        #ORGANIZING

                            Grouping into blocks or chunks makes the page easier to understand.

                            also group similar information with similar style helps the user associate that style with a particular type of content.

<!--How will you make an AJAX call ?-->
<!--#AJAX-->

<script>
    /*
    * Understanding AJAX and Scripted HTTP
    *
    * HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
    *
    * The Term Ajax describes an architecture for web applications that prominently features scripted HTTP
    *
    *       Ajax Key feature of an Ajax application is that it uses scripted HTTP to initiate data exchange
    *       with a web server without causing pages to reload. The abiilty to avoid page reloads results in responsive
    *       web applications that feel more like traditional web applications.
    *
    *
    *       Examples of using Ajax technologies:
    *
    *           log user interaction data to the server or to imporove its start-up time by displaying only a simple page at first
    *           and then downloading additional data and page components on an as-needed basis.
    *
    *
    *   The Term Comet refers to a related web application architecture that uses scripted HTTP.
    *           You can say that Comet is the opposite of Ajax or the reverse of Ajax: In comet it is the web server
    *           that
    *           initiates the communication asynchronously sending messages to the client. If the web application needs to respond to these messages
    *           sent by the server, it can then use Ajax Techniques to send or request data. In Ajax, the client pulls data from the server.
    *
    *
    *           Comet pushes data to Client
    *           Ajax Pulls data from server
    *
    *
    *           Examples of HTTP GET Request
    *
    *               <img src="/url">
    *
    *                   will download an image from that url.

<!--Large client side applications have always been hard to write, hard to organize and hard to maintain. They tend to quickly grow out of control as you add more functionality and developers to a project. Ext JS 4 comes with a new application architecture that not only organizes your code but reduces the amount you have to write.-->

<!--Our application architecture follows an MVC-like pattern with Models and Controllers being introduced for the first time. There are many MVC architectures, most of which are slightly different from one another. Here's how we define ours:-->

    <!--Model is a collection of fields and their data (e.g. a User model with username and password fields). Models know how to persist themselves through the data package, and can be linked to other models through associations. Models work a lot like the Ext JS 3 Record class, and are normally used with Stores to present data into grids and other components-->

    <!--View is any type of component - grids, trees and panels are all views.-->

    <!--Controllers are special places to put all of the code that makes your app work - whether that's rendering views, instantiating Models, or any other app logic.-->

<!--In this guide we'll be creating a very simple application that manages User data. By the end you will know how to put simple applications together using the new Ext JS 4 application architecture.-->

<!--The application architecture is as much about providing structure and consistency as it is about actual classes and framework code. Following the conventions unlocks a number of important benefits:-->

    <!--Every application works the same way so you only have to learn it once-->
    <!--It's easy to share code between apps because they all work the same way-->
    <!--You can use our build tools to create optimized versions of your applications for production use-->


<!-- EVENT BUBBLING
#EventBubbling
#EVENTS

First let talk about EVENTS


What is an EVENT? There are common ways in which people interact with each type of object.

For Example, in a car a driver will typically use at least two pedals. The car has designed to respond differently when the driver
interacts with each of the different pedals:

       the  accelerator makes the car go faster
       the brake slows it down.


  An event is the computer's way of sticking up its hand and say "Hey this just happened!"


Hotel will regularly have bookings for rooms. Each time a room is reserved, an event called book can be
used to triggercode that will increase the value of the bookings property. Likewise a cancel event can trigger code that
decreases the value of the bookings property.


So when you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events.

            Interactions with objects creates events
            events trigger code
            code responds to users

    onload                                The Browser has finished loading the page.
    onKeyDown                               The user pushes a keyboard key.
    onmouseout                              The User moves the mouse away from an HTML Element.
    onmouseover                             The user moves the mouse over an HTML element.
    onclick                                 The user clicks an HTML element.
    onchange                                An Element has been changed.

<!--Tell me your background ?-->
|<!--What kind of Projects you working on ?-->
<!--
#Backgound
#MyProjects

At the level of a senior full-stack engineer we're perhaps talking about architecting a modular Backbone/AngularJS front-end whilst optimising content delivery and tweaking hardware accelerated layers in CSS, followed by implementing an async non-blocking backend (which also pre-renders templates on the server), and pushing to an AWS cluster which has been built with security and scaleability in mind. Not to mention design. Designing UI responsively and mobile-first is essential, utilising a CSS pre-processor to save time. And remember to setup Nagios for monitoring. Oh, and ideally when the Continuous Integration server detects a bad build because your end-to-end tests have failed,
get it to send you an SMS with the build error messages. Well, the last two are probably for bonus points.

 <!--What is promises in JavaScript-->
  <!-- #promises   -->
<!--
So Promises have not been something available in native JavaScript Now with ES6 available this year
Promises are now natively supported. Why is this so imortant I can tell you that because Jaascript is single-threaded
meaning that two bits of script cannot not run at the same time, that have to run one after another.


JavaScript is single threaded, meaning that two bits of script cannot run at the same time, they have to run one after another. In browsers, JavaScript shares a thread with a load of other stuff. What that stuff is differs from browser to browser, but typically JavaScript is in the same queue as painting, updating styles, and handling user actions (such as highlighting text and interacting with form controls). Activity in one of these things delays the others.

As a human being, you're multithreaded. You can type with multiple fingers, you can drive and hold a conversation at the same time. The only blocking function we have to deal with is sneezing, where all current activity must be suspended for the duration of the sneeze. That's pretty annoying, especially when you're driving and trying to hold a conversation. You don't want to write code that's sneezy.

You've probably used events and callbacks to get around this. Here are events:

var img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');

img1.addEventListener('load', function() {
  // woo yey image loaded
});

img1.addEventListener('error', function() {
  // argh everything's broken
});

This isn't sneezy at all. We get the image, add a couple of listeners, then JavaScript can stop executing until one of those listeners is called.

Unfortunately, in the example above, it's possible that the events happened before we started listening for them, so we need to work around that using the "complete" property of images:

var img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');

function loaded() {
  // woo yey image loaded
}

if (img1.complete) {
  loaded();
}
else {
  img1.addEventListener('load', loaded);
}

img1.addEventListener('error', function() {
  // argh everything's broken
});

This doesn't catch images that error'd before we got a chance to listen for them, unfortunately the DOM doesn't give us a way to do that. Also, this is loading one image, things get even more complex if we want to know when a set of images have loaded.
Events aren't always the best way

Events are great for things that can happen multiple times on the same object — keyup, touchstart etc. With those events you don't really care about what happened before you attached the listener. But when it comes to async success/failure, ideally you want something like:

img1.callThisIfLoadedOrWhenLoaded(function() {
  // loaded
}).orIfFailedCallThis(function() {
  // failed
});

// and…
whenAllTheseHaveLoaded([img1, img2]).callThis(function() {
  // all loaded
}).orIfSomeFailedCallThis(function() {
  // one or more failed
});

This is what promises do, but with better naming. If HTML image elements had a "ready" method that returned a promise, we could do:

img1.ready().then(function() {
  // loaded
}, function() {
  // failed
});

// and…
Promise.all([img1.ready(), img2.ready()]).then(function() {
  // all loaded
}, function() {
  // one or more failed
});

At their most basic, promises are a bit like event listeners except:

    A promise can only succeed or fail once. It cannot succeed or fail twice, neither can it switch from success to failure or vice versa
    If a promise has succeeded or failed and you later add a success/failure callback, the correct callback will be called, even though the event took place earlier

This is extremely useful for async success/failure, because you're less interested in the exact time something became available, and more interested in reacting to the outcome.
Promise terminology

Domenic Denicola proof read the first draft of this article and graded me "F" for terminology. He put me in detention, forced me to copy out States and Fates 100 times, and wrote a worried letter to my parents.
Despite that, I still get a lot of the terminology mixed up, but here are the basics:

A promise can be:

fulfilled
    The action relating to the promise succeeded
rejected
    The action relating to the promise failed
pending
    Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet
settled
    Has fulfilled or rejected

 The spec also uses the term thenable to describe an object that is promise-like, in that it has a then method. This term reminds me of
 ex-England Football Manager Terry Venables so I'll be using it as little as possible.

 The promise constructor takes one argument, a callback with two parameters, resolve and reject. Do something within the callback, perhaps async, then call resolve if everything worked, otherwise call reject

-->



<script>
var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
// do a thing, possibly async, then…

if (/* everything turned out fine */) {
  resolve("Stuff worked!");
}
else {
  reject(Error("It broke"));
}
});


//Father and Son Forecast Promise

// function somewhere in father-controller.js
var makePromiseWithSon = function() {
    // This service's function returns a promise, but we'll deal with that shortly
    SonService.getWeather()
        // then() called when son gets back
        .then(function(data) {
            // promise fulfilled
            if (data.forecast==='good') {
                prepareFishingTrip();
            } else {
                prepareSundayRoastDinner();
            }
        }, function(error) {
            // promise rejected, could log the error with: console.log('error', error);
            prepareSundayRoastDinner();
        });
};

// The response from the 'Fishing Weather API' will
// be returned with the promise, if it was fulfilled. It will be in the format: { "forecast": "good" }

app.factory('SonService', function ($http, $q) {
       return {
           getWeather: function() {
               // the $http API is based on the deferred/promise APIs exposed by the $q service
               // so it returns a promise for us by default
               return $http.get('http://fishing-weather-api.com/sunday/afternoon')
                   .then(function(response) {
                       if (typeof response.data === 'object') {
                           return response.data;
                       } else {
                           // invalid response
                           return $q.reject(response.data);
                       }

                   }, function(response) {
                       // something went wrong
                       return $q.reject(response.data);
                   });
           }
       };
   });

  //  This analogy demonstrates the asynchronous nature of the request the dad makes to his son, for the weather forecast. The dad doesn't
  // want to wait at the door in anticipation when the son leaves, because he has other stuff to do. Instead, he makes a promise at the door, and decides what will happen in either of the 3 scenarios (good weather/bad weather/no forecast). The son immediately gives a promise to his dad when he leaves, and will resolve or reject it on his return.
  //
  //  The son is dealing with an asynchronous service (searching the sky with his telescope/using a weather API) to get data, but all of this is correctly abstracted away from his old man, who doesn't really understand technology!

<!--What kind of data type you get from Server ?-->

<!--
  jQuery is a Javascript file you include in your pages. Once include it makes it faster and easier to write cross-browser
  JavaScript, based in two steps:

        1. Using SS-style selectors to collect one or more nodes from the DOM tree.
        2. USing jQuery's built-in methods to work with the elements in that selection.
            - Jquery's CSS selector syntax makes it easier to select elements to work with.
            - It also has methods that make it easier to traverse the DOM.
            -jQuery offers methods that make it quick and simple to acheive a range of tasks that JavaScript
            -programmers commonly need to perform



    So lets move into the topic about loading data into part of a page without having to refresh the entire page.
    The data you get from the server can be a number of ways:

        JSON JavaScript Object Notation
        XML  Extensible Markup Language
        HTML HyperText Markup Language


    These are the most typical servers send back


    [XML]


      Requesting XML Data is very similar to requesting HTML. However, processing the data that is returned is
      more complicated because the XML must be converted into HTML in order to be shown on the page.



-->

<!-- Whenever a server responds with XML, it can be obtained using the responseXML property  -->

<script>

<!--Data types available in Javascript ? Int, String, Floar, Boolean, Object , Array-->

 <!-- Primary Data Types

  #String
    'String' is used when your trying to add any kind of text
    'String' is used to add new Content to a page can contain HTML markup
    'String' data type is enclosed in quotes single and double quotes can be used.

  #number
      numbers = 1 one
      numbers = 2 can be used to handle the size of the page moving the position of a element.
                  or setting the amount of time an elemtn should take to fade in.


  #Boolean
      True  or False ?

       used in handling a conditional statement
       Boolean comes from the mathematician George Boole.

       When you think of boolean think of a light switch or
       binary numbers 0 and 1

       Examples
        #falsy
        In JavaScript, the empty string (""),
        null, undefined, NaN, +0, −0 and false

        #truthy
        and their complement, "truthy", to distinguish between strictly type-checked and coerced Booleans.

<!-- #Null and Undefined -->

<!--Javascript
//null is a language keyword that evaluates to a special value that is usually used to indicate the absence of a value.

Coming from SQL NULL means no value as opposed to a field containing 0, or an empty string or just spaces.

using the typeof operator on null returns the string "object", indicating that null can be thought of as a special
object value that indicate "no value" for numbers and strings as well as objects.

// Undefined represents a deeper kind of absence. It is the value of variable that have not been initialized and the value you
// get when you query the value of variable that has not been initialized yet and the value you get when you query the value of an object
// property or array element that does not exist yet.


The undefined value is also returned by functions that have no return value, and the value of function parameters for null


JS history Actionscript which is a deviation from ECMAScript 3

ECMAScript  3 is a read/write variable and it can be set to any value. This error is corrected in ECMAScript 5
and now undefined is a read-only in that version of that language. If you apply the typeof operator to the undefined value, it
returns "undefined, indicating that this value is the sole memeber of a special type"



DESPITE undefined and null's differences both have some similarities:

  -  they both indicate absence of value and can often be used interchangeably.
  -  the equality operator "==" considers them to be equal. ( Use the strict equality operator "===")
  -  Both are falsy values they behave like false when a boolean value is required.
  - they both don't have Properties or methods.
          - null.prototype // returns TypeError  "Cannot read property 'prototype' of null "
          - using null or [] or . also returns a TypeError

  In conclusion wheneveryou need to assign one of these values to a function null is always the right choice.
